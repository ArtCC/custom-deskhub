    environment:

    command: >
      sh -c "apk add --no-cache git &&

```

## Installation:

'Your GitHub token': Create a token in your GitHub account and use it to fetch data from GitHub GraphQL.
'Your port': Add the port you want to listen on; in my case, I use 3005 to avoid interference with other ports on my local server.
'Your url server': Add your server's IP address here; in my case, I use `http://192.168.50.244`.
